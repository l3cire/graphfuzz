## Running the Fuzzer

### Installation

Before running the fuzzer, you need to install the necessary dependencies. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing the Fuzzer

```bash
python3 main.py <fuzzer_name> --num_iterations <num_iterations> --use_multiple_graphs --feedback_check_type <feedback_check_type> --scheduler <disk/memory> --output <output_mode>
```

In this command, replace `<fuzzer_name>` with one of the available fuzzer names, for instance: `AdamicAdar`, `BCC`, `HarmonicCentrality`, `JaccardSimilarity`, `MAXFV`, `MaxMatching`, `MST`, `SCC`, `STPL`.

Optional arguments:
- `--num_iterations <iterations>`: Set the number of iterations (default: 100).
- `--use_multiple_graphs`: Use multiple graphs for the fuzzer. If excluded, the fuzzer will start with one graph containing a single node.
- `--feedback_check_type <feedback_type>`: Specify the type of feedback to use:
  - `regular`: Algorithm-Specific checks.
  - `coverage`: Line coverage-based checks.
  - `combination`: Both `regular` and `coverage` checks.
  - `branch`: Branch coverage-based checks.
  - `hop_count`: Track number of edges (hops) in shortest path (STPL-specific).
  - `negative_edges`: Track count of negative weight edges in shortest path (STPL-specific).
  - `component_distribution`: Track component size distribution pattern (SCC-specific).
  - `trivial_ratio`: Track ratio of singleton components (SCC-specific).
  - `saturated_edges`: Track count of saturated edges in max flow (MAXFV-specific).
  - `max_degree`: Track maximum degree in MST (MST-specific).
  - `none`: Disable feedback checks.
- `--scheduler <disk/mem>`: Choose the scheduler type:
  - `mem`: Use RandomMemScheduler to keep graphs in memory.
  - `disk`: Use RandomDiskScheduler to save graphs to disk.
- `--folder <folder>`: Specify the folder to save graphs when using disk scheduler (default: `graphs_folder`).
- `--output <output_mode>`: Choose the output mode:
  - `file`: Save logs to a file.
  - `console`: Print logs to the console (default: `console`).
- `--timeout <timeout>`: Set a timeout for each operation in seconds (default: 20 seconds).

Additionally, you can execute `python3 main.py -h` to view more details and options available for running the fuzzers.

Example usage:
```bash
python3 main.py SCC --num_iterations 100 --feedback_check_type regular --output file

python3 main.py SCC --num_iterations 100 --feedback_check_type coverage --output console --scheduler disk --folder ./graphs_folder
```

### Logging

The fuzzer will produce a diverse set of graphs stored in a `.pkl` file within the `Corpus` directory. The `Log` directory will contain the detailed execution logs, as well as any graphs that may exhibit bugs if any are discovered.
